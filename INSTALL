TyphonIO 1.6 installation 
====================================

1) Preliminary 
==============
Building TyphonIO requires a working versions of:

*  Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) 1.8.X 
More information can be found at http://www.hdfgroup.org

*  Standard GNU Make

*  C99 compliant C compiler (Fortran compiler optional)

*  For parallel typhonIO, an implementation of the MPI message-passing library (with matching HDF5 package!)


2) Configuration
================

Modify src/Makefile.inc for your specific compiler options/flags; currently supported compilers include:

Set the build environment to recognise your specific compiler by using the environment
variable HPC_COMPILER. Currently supported compilers, with the options to use, include:

*  gcc   - GNU Compiler
*  intel - Intel Compiler
*  pgi   - Portland Group PGI compiler
*  xl    - IBM XL

   e.g.
     export HPC_COMPILER=gcc

   alternatively this can be set as part of the make command (see section 3) using:
     make HPC_COMPILER=gcc

Edit src/Makefile to specify the HDF5 library path, HDF5_DIR,
and the PROD_DIR environment variables to set the path of build directory

   e.g.
     PROD_DIR=/local/usr/lammps/lib/hdf5/typhonio/build
     HDF5_DIR=/usr/local/hdf5

   alternatively pass these into make as above for the compiler.


3) Compilation
==============

Full options for building TyphonIO can be displayed by typing "make" in the src directory.
This will give a list of compile options. It is good practice to check the current typhonIO
configuration using "make config" before building.

To build the serial version:

  $ cd src
  $ make install HPC_COMPILER=<[gcc/intel/pgi/xl]> HDF5_DIR=<path/to/hdf5> PROD_DIR=<path/to/install>

To build the parallel version:

  $ cd src
  $ make install USEMPI=1 HPC_COMPILER=<compiler option> HDF5_DIR=<path/to/hdf5> PROD_DIR=<path/to/install>

Note that the installation also builds the Fortran API library by deafult. 
To exclude the F90 library, use NOF90=1.

4) Documentation 
================

The user's manual are available in the docs/ directory, as well as the sample programs of the distribution.
