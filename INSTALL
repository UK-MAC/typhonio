TyphonIO 1.6 installation 
====================================

1) Preliminary 
==============
Building TyphonIO requires a working versions of:

*  Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) 1.8.X 
More information can be found at http://www.hdfgroup.org

*  Standard GNU Make

*  C99 compliant C compiler (Fortran compiler optional)

*  For parallel typhonIO, an implementation of the MPI message-passing library (with matching HDF5 package!)


2) Configuration
================

Modify src/Makefile.inc for specific compiler options/flags, currently supported compilers includes

*  GNU Compiler
*  Intel Compiler
*  Portland Group PGI compiler
*  IBM XL

Set the build environment to recognise specific compilers by using HPC_COMPILER
e.g. 
export HPC_COMPILER=gcc

Edit the src/Makefile to specify the HDF5 library path HDF5_DIR, 
and PROD_DIR environment variables to set the path of build directory


3) Compilation
==============

Instruction for building typhonIO distribution by typing "make" in src, which should show compile options
It's good practice to check the current typhonIO configuration using "make config" before build with "make install"

Note that install also build Fortran API library, to exclude F90 library, use NOF90=1.

4) Documentation 
================

The user's manual are available in the doc/ directory, as well as the sample programs of the distribution.
